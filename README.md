# Gym Progress Tracker PWA

🚀 This is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** designed to help users track their gym progress efficiently. 
Tired of logging my workout results in a WhatsApp conversation with myself and never reviewing them, 
I created this app trying to provide an intuitive and continuous way to monitor fitness progress.
